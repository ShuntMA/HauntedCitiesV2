# HauntedCitiesV2

Haunted Cities is an AR puzzle game using the WRLD API to generate 3d maps of cities to play in right on your tabletop. Built to support both ARCore and ARkit this current version supports both but there are a few more bugs with the ARKit version than ARCore. 

The app was built with Unity and is a work in progress, consider it an early alpha version. You are able to test in editor by enabling debugging on the ARSession in the inspector whilst viewing the London or New York scenes. This does not enable full AR view or function though for this the best option is to build into an APK and test on a supported phone. - https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices
